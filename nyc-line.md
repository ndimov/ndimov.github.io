title: NYC Line Dance
---

NYC has a lot of country line dance and two-step events! This page describes the regular events in the city.

Events are roughly sorted by popularity among regular dancers, my personal familiarity, and event frequency. Check their website and instagram for updates, since dates often change and sometimes they host one-off popup events (especially in summer). Instagram is also great for videos and pictures to get a vibe of what each event is like!
