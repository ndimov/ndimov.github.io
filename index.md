Hi! I'm Nicholai. I'm passionate about solving interesting problems, whether it's software engineering, math, or puzzles.

Check out the [course linker](/course-linker) I built, used by hundreds of students to search for, join, and upload group chats for each of their classes. Gone are the days of asking "is there a chat for calc 3?" in the group chat for our entire grade! My website makes it fast and easy, and I'm proud to see how many students use it each semester.

I am currently pursuing a combined major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a double major in Financial Engineering at WashU. I'm also the founder and president of the [WU Puzzle Club](https://grouporganizer.wustl.edu/organization/wupuzzleclub). We create and solve crosswords, logic puzzles, and [puzzlehunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_hunt).
