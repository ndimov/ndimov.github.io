Hi! I'm Nicholai, and I'm passionate about solving interesting problems, whether it's software engineering, math, or puzzles.

For summer 2022, I am working at Meta in Seattle as a member of the Algorithmic Optimization team. I am majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Linguistics at WashU. I'm also the founder and president of the [WU Puzzle Club](https://grouporganizer.wustl.edu/organization/wupuzzleclub), where we create and solve crosswords, logic puzzles, and [puzzlehunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_hunt).
