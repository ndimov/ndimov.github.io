Hi! I'm Nicholai, and I care about building quality solutions with a clear impact. I write software at [Clay](https://www.clay.com/) in New York, the platform for creative go-to-market teams (and with a $1.25B valuation, growing fast!).
<!-- I'm passionate about solving interesting problems, whether it's in software engineering, math, or puzzles. -->

Previously, I've been at:
* [Matroid](https://matroid.com/) in Palo Alto, scaling computer vision infrastructure
* Meta in Seattle, optimizing datacenter rack placement
* WashU, BS/MS '24 in Computer Science and Mathematics. Minor in Linguistics

I love to pack my schedule with a variety of activities, especially:
* Dance
    - [Fusion](https://www.pearling.org/dance/what-is-fusion-dance), Brazilian Zouk, [Country Line](nyc-line), Contact Improv, etc.
* Puzzles
    - Puzzle hunts are great! I once spent close to a year [building the 2023 MIT Mystery Hunt]({% post_url 2023-01-26-mitmh-2023 %}) with team teammate. If you like maps, check out my puzzle [City Placement](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/interestingthings.museum/puzzles/city-placement).
    - I also love logic puzzle contests ([some](https://gp.worldpuzzle.org/) [favorites](https://logicmastersindia.com/)), solving crosswords, and more!
* Biking everywhere
* Singing
* Board games
* Hiking
* Exploring new places (near and far)
