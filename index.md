Hi! I'm Nicholai, and I'm passionate about solving interesting problems, whether it's software engineering, math, or puzzles.

This summer, I am working at [Matroid](https://matroid.com/), a Palo Alto startup at the forefront of computer vision. I spent last summer at Meta in Seattle as a member of the Algorithmic Optimization team, optimizing the allocations of millions of servers. I am pursuing a combined Bachelor's & Master's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Linguistics at WashU.

I spent much of the last year [building the 2023 MIT Mystery Hunt]({% post_url 2023-01-26-mitmh-2023 %}) with team teammate. If you like maps, check out my puzzle [City Placement](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/interestingthings.museum/puzzles/city-placement). I'm also the founder and president of the [WashU Puzzle Club](https://wustl.presence.io/organization/puzzle-club), where we create and solve crosswords, logic puzzles, and of course puzzle hunts.

Other activities I enjoy include board games, hiking, (swing) dancing, biking, climbing, and exploring new places.
