Hi! I'm Nicholai, and I'm passionate about solving interesting problems, whether it's software engineering, math, or puzzles.

I spent much of the last year building the 2023 [MIT Mystery Hunt](https://puzzles.mit.edu/) with teammate. If you like maps, check out my puzzle [City Placement](https://interestingthings.museum/puzzles/city-placement) (login may be required). I'm also the founder and president of the [WU Puzzle Club](https://wustl.presence.io/organization/puzzle-club), where we create and solve crosswords, logic puzzles, and of course puzzle hunts.

Last summer, I worked at Meta in Seattle as a member of the Algorithmic Optimization team, optimizing the allocations of millions of servers. I am majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Linguistics at WashU.
