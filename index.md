Hi! I'm Nicholai. I'm passionate about solving interesting problems, whether it's software engineering, math, or puzzles.

Check out the [course linker](/course-linker) I built, used by hundreds of students to search for, join, and upload group chats for each of their classes.

I am currently pursuing a combined major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a double major in Financial Engineering at WashU.
